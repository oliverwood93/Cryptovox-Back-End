# Cryptovox Back End

This is the back end API service for Cryptovox; a secure file sharing app that uses audio to encrypt file.

To see what APIs are supported click [here](https://ssc-be.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following are required to use the app:
1. Python 3.7 with pip and Pycharm (or another appropriate alternative IDE).
2. AWS S3 account (the key and secret): this will be used to create workspaces and save encrypted files in workspaces. As long as the keys (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) are in your environment variables, the AWS library will use this.
3. ACR account (the key and secret): this will be used to get the audio metadata which will be used for the audio analysis. See the acrconfig.py file (audio_analysis folder) for the data you'll need from your ACR account. 
4. Postgres for the database.

### Installing

#### Get the code

Fork the project from git. Then copy the git url and in the appropriate folder on your machine:

```
git clone <url from git>
```
This will create the project on your local machine. Open the project in your chose IDE.

#### Setup the app locally
In the terminal, run the following to install the necessary packages:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install the database:
_It is wise to comment out the inserts so fresh data is added as you use the system._
```
 psql -f setup.sql
```

#### Run the app locally
Right click on server.py then click on create (right below the debug) to setup the environment variables; this is where you'd add the ACR config and your AWS config (if you're not saving this in an aws file).
